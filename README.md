Library control system build in Kotlin programming language and based on the domain model extracted from the book "Unified Modeling Language" by brazilian academic Guileanes Guedes
(Pampa Federal University) for software and computing professionals. The system consists of a graphical interface that runs in memory and interacts with intrinsec funcionalities 
for four different types of users (librarians, teachers, students and individuals from the external community). Each of thosen mentioned has different levels of access and privileges.
In this way, the librarians has more privileged levels of access, for example, they can add more copies of books to the library. A librarian can only be registered through another librarian (see the administrative librarian). With respect to other features, the access is the same for all four types.
